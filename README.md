#### Intro  
We created an app to read in handwritten digits in table form and conver them into digital tables that can be copied into a spreadsheet.  
  
#### Data  
[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [Semeion](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Semeion+Handwritten+Digit) Handwritten Digit databases  
  
#### Segmentation  
Used Gradient Filter to segment the image into individual digits  
  
#### Model  
Used Keras to build Convolutional Neural Network  
  
#### Tableization  
Identify single vs multi digit numbers in cells and classifying cells into rows and columns
